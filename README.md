## (A) How to run the app

## First run
### `npm install`

## Then run
### `npm start`


## To run tests use:

### `npm run test`

## (B) Highlights

### Made the app completely responsive to work across different screen sizes
### Implemented the search functionality in such a way that it won't spam the api with network requests on every key stroke
### Demonstrated Redux for state management
### Wrote some basic tests with react-testing-library
### Used appropriate console logs
### Implemented all the required functionalities including search and details 

## (C) Possible Improvements Without Time Constraints

### Given more time, more complex tests could be implemented along with mock network requests to test all possible scenarios
### Infinite scrolling could have been implemented with Intersection Observer rather than using a library, It would give us more fine grained control over our app (We might need it if we want to implement scroll animations or similar things)
### Adding subtle animations, Improving color profile

## (D) Feedback

### Used redux only for demonstration purposes, It is not required for an app of this scale
